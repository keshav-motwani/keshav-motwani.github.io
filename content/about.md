title: About Me

I am a mathematics and statistics undergraduate student at the University of Florida. My research interests are in high-dimensional statistics, multivariate analysis, and numerical optimization with applications in genomics.

I am currently working with Aaron Molstad on developing model-based methods for integrative multi-view prediction in single-cell genomics data. I also work with Todd Brusko, Victor Greiff, and Geir Kjetil Sandve on analyzing immune repertoire data in type 1 diabetes.
