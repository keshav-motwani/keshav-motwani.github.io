I am an undergraduate student at the University of Florida majoring in Mathematics and Statistics. 

My research interests are broadly in high-dimensional statistical learning and numerical optimization motivated by applications in genomics.

I currently work with [Aaron Molstad](https://ajmolstad.github.io/) on developing model-based statistical methods for integrating many single-cell genomics datasets for regression/classification tasks. Specifically, we are working on a integrative multinomial regression model for datasets in which we only observe binned versions of some fine categories in some datasets and batch effects in the predictors. The goal is to predict categories at the finest possible resolution on new data.

In the past I've worked with [Todd Brusko](https://bruskolab.diabetes.ufl.edu/) and [Victor Greiff](https://greifflab.org/) on analyzing and developing software for immune receptor sequencing and single-cell genomics data in the context of type 1 diabetes. 

You can see some of my work on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8AhTuSEAAAAJ&hl=en) profile and my [Github](https://github.com/keshav-motwani) page.
