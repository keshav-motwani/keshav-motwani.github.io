I am an undergraduate student at the University of Florida majoring in Mathematics and Statistics. 

My research interests are broadly in high-dimensional statistical learning and numerical optimization motivated by applications in genomics.

I am currently working with [Aaron Molstad](https://ajmolstad.github.io/) and [Rhonda Bacher](https://www.rhondabacher.com/) to develop model-based statistical methods for integrating many single-cell genomics datasets for prediction tasks. Specifically, we are working on a integrative multinomial logsitic regression model for developing a classifier from multiple datasets in which labels are available in differing levels of detail across datasets, as is common for cell types in single-cell genomics data. The goal is to predict categories at the greatest level of detail on new data.

In the past I've worked with [Todd Brusko](https://bruskolab.diabetes.ufl.edu/) and [Victor Greiff](https://greifflab.org/) on analyzing and developing software for immune receptor sequencing and single-cell genomics data in the context of type 1 diabetes. 

You can see some of my work on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8AhTuSEAAAAJ&hl=en) profile and my [Github](https://github.com/keshav-motwani) page.

My CV is available [here](https://keshav-motwani.github.io/CV.pdf).
