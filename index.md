# Keshav Motwani

I am a mathematics and statistics undergraduate student at the University of Florida interested in the intersection of statistics, machine learning, and biology. My current research focuses on the analysis and development of methods for large-scale genomics data, particularly single-cell RNA-seq and immune receptor sequencing data using machine learning, natural language processing, and multivariate statistical methods. I also develop software tools to streamline the process of data exploration and interpretation in areas related to my research. Some of my projects can be viewed here: https://github.com/keshav-motwani.
